# Laravel & project-related files & directories
# ---------------------------------------------

# This file stores definitions of environment variables. As soon as
# the framework boots, the contents of the file are converted into
# actual environment variables that are made available globally.
.env

# This file has the same purpose as the `env` file but it is used
# to configure Laravel Dusk, a testing tool that allows to use a
# real headless web browser in order to test the application.
.env.dusk.local

# This directory stores files that are used to seed the database.
/database/seeds/data

# This file is automatically generated by Laravel Mix.
/public/mix-manifest.json

# The CSS files are generated from Sass and, as a result, will
# change every time Sass assets change. Because of this, we
# don’t need to keep track of them under version control.
/public/css


# Third-party packages & libraries
# --------------------------------

# The Composer dependency manager installs packages into this directory.
# Files stored there must never be modified since any change would be
# discarded as soon as an update of the dependencies is triggered.
/vendor

# NPM, a package manager for JavaScript, installs libraries and other
# pieces of third-party code into this directory. Similarly to how
# Composer works, files in there are not supposed to be touched.
/node_modules


# Generated files
# ---------------

# This directory may be used to store database snapshots. This data
# must obvioulsy not be tracked under version control because it
# will contain sensitive information that mustn’t be published.
/database/snapshots
